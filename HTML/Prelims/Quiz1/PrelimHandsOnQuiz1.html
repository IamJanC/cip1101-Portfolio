                Quezon City is situated in the National Capital Region (NCR) of the Philippines, just north of Manila. 
                It is the largest city in Metro Manila in terms of land area and serves as a key hub for government institutions, education, and commerce. 
                The city is well-connected through major roads like EDSA, Commonwealth Avenue, and Quezon Avenue, making it highly accessible. 
                It is home to several prominent landmarks, including the Quezon Memorial Circle, University of the Philippines Diliman, and the Araneta Coliseum.

                Quezon City was established in 1939 and was originally planned to be the new capital of the Philippines, replacing Manila. 
                The city’s development began in the 1940s, but its growth truly accelerated after World War II. 
                It was named after Manuel L. Quezon, the second President of the country, who envisioned a modern city with wide streets and organized districts. 
                The city's layout was designed by American architect William E. Parsons, inspired by the "Garden City" concept. 
                Although it served as the capital from 1948 to 1976, the title was later returned to Manila. Today, Quezon City remains a vital center for politics, education, and business in the country.

                When I was young, my parents and I lived in Montalban, Rizal, a quiet province surrounded by nature. 
                While the fresh air and peaceful environment were nice, I often found it boring — our subdivision was too silent, and there weren’t many people around. 
                Quezon City, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. 
                Every once in a while, we’d visit my cousins and relatives here, and those trips were always filled with laughter, noise, and warmth. 
                We'd spend time in places like Quezon Memorial Circle and UP Diliman, making unforgettable memories.
                When I reached Grade 7, my parents decided to buy a house here, and we moved for good. 
                Over time, my cousins, uncles, and aunts relocated elsewhere, but my love for Quezon City never faded. 
                The Quezon Memorial Circle, where we once had family picnics, is now the same place I jog every Sunday. 
                St. Peter’s Church, which I used to dislike because my parents made me go, is now a place I sometimes visit after school just to sit and reflect.
                Time has changed, people have moved on, and things are different now — but this city is where I grew up. 
                It shaped me into who I am today. 
                I’ve come to realize that I am more of a "city guy" than a "province guy." 
                I love the sound of people talking, the hum of traffic, and the endless places to go. 
                Transportation has also become more convenient, connecting me to malls, hospitals, churches, and government buildings with ease. 
                Quezon City isn’t just a "favourite" place to me — it’s home.
