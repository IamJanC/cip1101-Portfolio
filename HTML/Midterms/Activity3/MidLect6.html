                I remember a question I once encountered during my elementary days. 
                <br><br>
                <i>"Jan, ano ang mas nakakatakot? Tao o multo?"</i>
                <br><br>
                <i>"Multo, syempre," I responded without hesitation.</i>
                <br><br>
                <i>"Mali, tao dapat. Kasi sila yung kaya kang saktan. Yung multo, nandiyan lang."</i>
                <br><br>
                It was one of those silly riddles that kids would throw around, followed by playful debates. They’d argue that people are more dangerous—after all, a person can stab you, throw a punch, or physically hurt you. Others would dismiss ghosts entirely, saying they don’t exist.
                Oh, how I wish I could go back in time and tell them the truth—that ghosts not only exist, but they can be dangerous in ways we never imagined.
                
                <br><br>
              
                We once thought ghosts were merely fictional—phantoms confined to horror stories or the supernatural realm. But as we grew older, we learned a painful truth: people can be ghosts too.
                
                Dreams can be heavy, especially when they rest in the shadow of reality. Some days, the weight of my emotions feels unbearable. I try to convince myself to move on, only to find my thoughts drifting back—circling around someone who is far beyond my reach. Someone I can no longer hold. Someone who is no longer here.
                <br><br>
                It’s true that ghosts cannot harm you physically. But then, why does it feel like they do? There are no wounds to show proof of the pain. Yet, my chest tightens, and my heart aches as if I’ve been struck by something unseen.
                Are ghosts really harmless? At least you can see people. At least you can brace yourself for their arrival. But ghosts? You never see them coming. Day or night, whatever the hour, they creep up on you—only making their presence known when it’s already too late. When you realize they’ve never truly left. They’ve been haunting you all along.
                So I wonder—when? When will I finally be free?

        <h1>7. Present an image with a CSS application. Specify the CSS hovering effect that you have used. (3pts)</h1>
        <p>For this presentation, I used the CSS <span class="code">:hover</span> pseudo-class. When the user's mouse hovers over the image, it increases in size by 1%.</p>

        <h1>8. Present an image with a CSS application. Specify the CSS box shadow effect that you have used. (2pts)</h1>
        <p>
            For this presentation, I used the CSS box-shadow property. I set the first value (horizontal offset) to 25px and the second value (vertical offset) to 15px to make the shadow more noticeable, using the color rgb(128, 127, 127) (light gray). 
            This simulates an image with a light source positioned at the top right.
